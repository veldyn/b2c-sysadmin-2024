#H1 Oakland University: Bridge to Cyber 
## Established 2024
### Main collaborators: David, Bethany

House keeping notes:
- You can use LibreOffice to edit the PDF labs. Last time we checked this was a free service. 
- If you want to use a Kanban style system, use the **System Administration Log** in **Projects**.
- You'll have to create an *issue* if you want to be able to assign specific tasks and make comments within **Projects**.
- Have fun :)

###The intention###
The goal of this work is to help others with little no to computer background understand some fundamentals
about tools that we think they might need in their upcoming cybersecurity career. 
This is one of three concentrations: the other two are networking and programming. 

We hope that everyone involved in the project learns useful skills. 

###Table of Contents###
Unit 1 - focuses on virtual machines (VMs) and the intracies of Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20
Unit 2 - focuses on maintenance of virtual machines and other knowledge we think would be useful on an enterprise level
Unit 3 - focuses on containers, specifically Docker, their setup and maintenance
Unit 4 - discusses kubernetes as a container management system and its management

This ToC is flexible and only reflects the current idea we have for this project. 

In terms of  the **System Administration Log**, the Archive section is for "Done" *issues* that are older and don't need to be on your radar anymore. Hopefully this saves you time in searching for *issues*. 

Best of luck!
